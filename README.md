## Description

This Rock-Paper-Scissors game, authored by Blessing Fortune Kwomo, allows you to play against the computer. You can choose rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer will make a random choice. The script will then determine the winner and print the result.

## How to Play

1. Run the script or open the web page.
2. When prompted, enter your choice: 'r' for rock, 'p' for paper, or 's' for scissors.
3. The script will display the computer's choice and the result of the game.

## Code Explanation

### game() Function

The `game()` function is the main function that handles user input, generates the computer's choice, and determines the result of the game.

```python
import random

def game():
    user_choice = input("Choose one: 'r' for rock, 'p' for paper, 's' for scissors\n")
    computer_choice = random.choice(['r', 'p', 's'])

    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        return 'It\'s a draw'

    if check_victory(user_choice, computer_choice):
        return 'Congratulations, you win!'

    return 'Sorry, you lose.'

def check_victory(player, opponent):
    # Determine if the player has won
    # rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock
    if (player == 'r' and opponent == 's') or \
       (player == 's' and opponent == 'p') or \
       (player == 'p' and opponent == 'r'):
        return True

print(game())
```

### check_victory() Function

The `check_victory()` function determines if the player has won the game based on the classic rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

```python
def check_victory(player, opponent):
    # Determine if the player has won
    # rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock
    if (player == 'r' and opponent == 's') or \
       (player == 's' and opponent == 'p') or \
       (player == 'p' and opponent == 'r'):
        return True
```

## Running the Script

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

    document.getElementById('result').innerText = `You chose ${convertChoice(userChoice)}, computer chose ${convertChoice(computerChoice)}. ${result}`;
}

function determineWinner(user, computer) {
    if (user === computer) {
        return "It's a draw!";
    }
    if ((user === 'r' && computer === 's') ||
